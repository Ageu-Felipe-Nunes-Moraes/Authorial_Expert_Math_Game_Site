# Math Expert (Website)

I developed an educational game called Math Expert entirely from concept to implementation, with the purpose of improving mathematical thinking speed. Inspired by my aspiration to strengthen essential cognitive skills for programming, I created this game to challenge players to solve mathematical operations within a time limit.

## Features

- **Math Challenges:** The game presents random mathematical operations to be solved.
- **Time Limit:** The player has a limited time to solve as many operations as possible.
- **Different Difficulty Levels:** The player can choose from different difficulty levels that affect the duration of the game.
- **Scoring:** Each correctly solved operation increases the player's score.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository of this game.
2. Open the index.html file in the browser.
3. On the home screen, choose one of the available difficulty levels.
4. The game will start, presenting mathematical operations to be solved.
5. Click on the correct answer for each operation within the time limit.
6. With each correct operation, your score will increase.
7. After the time is up, you can restart the game if you wish.
